# Bugfixes
Corrected issue with the `create_dist.py` script which was not properly using all host -based libraries during compilation. Splunk provides a number of standard libraries built-in and provides environment variables to direct Python scripts to utilize those libraries. Given that we are leaving the Splunk environment when creating new distributions and virtual environments this was causing issues with providing the correct packages needed for Python to compile with necessary modules (specifically `_ssl` and `pip`). We now remove those variables from the `os.environ` and pass it to the subprocess during the building.
