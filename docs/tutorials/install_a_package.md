# Install a PyPI package to a virtual environment
## Using PyPI Hub
The `PyPI Hub` dashboard is the simplest way to install a package to a virtual environment built for PyDen. After navigating to the dashboard in the PyDen Manager app, the user is presented with a text input for searching the packages in the Python Package Index. The input accepts wildcard (*) characters. After entering text into the input the table below will be filtered by the input value. Clicking a name in the table will display the description of the package in the panel to the right of the table. The description panel contains a drop-down selector with a list of available PyDen virtual environments. By selecting an environment and clicking the green `Install` button to the right of the selector the user will add the package and all necessary requirements to the selected virtual environment. Once clicked a blue rotating ![icon-rotate](../media/icon-rotate.png) icon will appear next to the button. If the installation succeeds, a green check mark will replace the icon. If there is an error of some kind, a red cross (X) will appear.

## Pip command
While the `PyPI Hub` dashboard should suffice in most cases, if the need arises to manually install a package, the user can do so by using the custom Splunk command `pip`. For specifics on the use of this command, refer to the [README](../README.md#custom-commands).
